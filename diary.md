# Day 2 (2024-10-03)

I continued working through chapter 4.

# Day 1 (2024-10-02)

I worked through chapter 3 of _Eloquent JavaScript_ and documented how to use
Deno as a REPL with a file to be evaluated first (e.g. containing function
definitions to be called inside the REPL).

I started reading chapter 4 in the evening on the train.

# Day 0 (2024-10-01)

It's October: the last quarter of the year, which I'd like to devote to web
frontend programmingâ€”at least for roughly one hour every morning.

I worked through chapter 2, which had some easy exercises to do.

By accident, I figured out that Deno has a `fmt` command, which seems to do the
same as `prettier`. Typing `deno fmt` and `prettier -w` is roughly the same, but
I'll stick to the former when I work with Deno, and use the latter in any other
environment.

# Day -1 (2024-09-30)

I read through chapter 1, which didn't have any exercises. The operator `??` was
new to me, and I wrote its semantics down in comparison to the `||` operator.

I also decided to use `prettier` as a formatter. By default, it uses double
quotes for strings, trailing commas, and a indentation with two space
characters. (I'd prefer four, but I'll stick to the standard settings
nonetheless.)

# Day -2 (2024-09-29)

I wanted to start the _Daily Frontend Grind_ in October; but here I am. I
finished my effort to learn Rust after 190 days today, in order to spend the
next three months with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular. Since it's not
October yet, I call this day "-2". But I'd like to get started anyway.

I just read the introduction of _Eloquent JavaScript_ (4th Edition). I'd like to
use Deno for the examples, except for those targeting the browser and Node.js.
Since Deno supports TypeScript out of the box, I'll also use it for _Essential
TypeScript_ (5th Edition).
