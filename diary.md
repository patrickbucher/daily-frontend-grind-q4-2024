# Day 48 (2024-11-18)

I started working through chapter 5, which repeats some basics about setting up
TypeScript projects from chapter 2.

# Day 47 (2024-11-17)

I summarized the part about modules and thereby finished summarizing chapter 4.
It's the middle of November, and only now I actually start with working on
TypeScript.

# Day 46 (2024-11-16)

I summarized the part about collections, i.e. objects, maps, and sets.:x

# Day 45 (2024-11-15)

I summarized the rest about the section about iterators and generators.

# Day 44 (2024-11-14)

I summarized the part about generators, for which I rewrote the number sequence
iterator from yesterday.

# Day 43 (2024-11-13)

Only little time for TypeScript today: I read the section about iterators and
generators, but only summarized the first part on iterators.

I worked a bit with the [PDFKit](https://pdfkit.org/) library for a
side-project. The API is relatively straightforward, but the behaviour of the
layout engine seems erratic to me.

# Day 42 (2024-11-12)

I summarized the part about classes, for which I re-implemented the prototype
chaining examples with recent JavaScript features.

# Day 41 (2024-11-11)

I continued working through chapter 4, for which I have summarized the part on
prototype chaining, which is rather weird and uncomfortable to use. Now I really
understand why JavaScript included classes and especially the `super` keyword,
which is far more flexible than accessing the prototype's implementation
explicitly using its constructor function name and its `call` method.

# Day 40 (2024-11-10)

I started reading chapter 4. I read the entire section about prototypes and
classes. I only summarized the first half of it. (I'd rather go slow now.)

# Day 39 (2024-11-09)

I finished chapter 3 with the section about the `this` keyword, which was quite
illuminating. I also added sub-headings to the chapter, which was really
necessary considering its length!

# Day 38 (2024-11-08)

I only summarized a small section on getters and setters, and I did _not_ do so
on paper. I think the depth of my approach surpasses the depth of the material
by far. But I'd like to continue with my approach for the time being.

# Day 37 (2024-11-07)

I read and summarized the section about JavaScript objects.

Later, I realized that I'd rather spend the entire December with TypeScript
than rushing through this book like through the last one, but drop Angular for
the moment. TypeScript is a solid foundation for leearning Angular later on.
And maybe I'll use it during the next term for the programming examples, which
will allow me to keep the knowledge warm.

The entire effort was a bit too rushed: First, I went through _Eloquent
JavaScript_ way too fast, and now I'm stuck with two "JavaScript Primer"
chapters in the next book. I should have planned this differently, i.e.
skipping _Eloeuqent JavaScript_ in the first place. Anyway, November/December
will be reserved for the second book, and if I have time left in late December,
I can still do the two Angular chapters in it.

# Day 36 (2024-11-06)

I extended yesterday's list of array methods with some examples. I also
summarized the rest about arrays, now on towards objects.

# Day 35 (2024-11-05)

I continued with chapter 3, but still have a long way to go.

# Day 34 (2024-11-04)

I read roughly half of chapter 3, but only managed to summarize 6 pages instead
of the 13-14 pages required to work through the entire book in November.

# Day 33 (2024-11-03)

I finished summarizing chapter 2. For the next two chapters, which are about
JavaScript, I shall follow a more pragmatic approach to summarizing it.

I decided to focus on the first two parts of the book, omitting part 3 about
standalone, Angular, and React applications. This leaves me with 13 chapters or
361 pages. There are 27 days left in November, so I need to work through and
summarize 13-14 pages every single day. I doubt that this is feasible with only
one hour per day. But I rather go deep than fast, so stretching TypeScript into
December might be the better option, but leaves me less time with Angular.

So for the next couple of days, I'll try to work through 13-14 pages every
single day. If I can't do this in my assigned morning hour, I need to change my
plans. Let's see.

# Day 32 (2024-11-02)

I continued with chapter 2 and integrated Inquirer.js into the example. The rest
of the chapter is about persistence, which I'd like to work through tomorrow.
Next up are two chapters on JavaScript, which I'd like to summarize very
concisely.

# Day 31 (2024-11-01)

I summarized the part of chapter 2 about adding an external dependency with
additional type hints. Next up is the actual usage of the external package
Inquirer.js.

# Day 30 (2024-10-31)

I continued summarizing chapter 2 and caught up with my green bookmark, which
indicates the progress of _summarizing_ the book, with the yellow bookmark,
which indicates the progress of _reading_ the book. Tomorrow, I'll start by
reading further ahead. There's still a lot to be done in this chapter; so I'll
probably will need more time to work through the entire book, even if I don't do
the third part, or only if I do so partially. (I'm thinking about doing the
standalone web application part, skipping the React and Angular part, but work
through the Angular book afterwards, instead.)

# Day 29 (2024-10-30)

I continued processing what I've read yesterday in chapter 2. Progress is slow,
but working this way has a calming effect on me. I process the information
deeper, which is a good start into the day. I'd like to continue in this way,
even if it will take me more time to get through the book.

However, I have to think about part 3 of the book, which is about applications
in vanilla DOM, Angular, and React. Maybe pen and paper are not a good choice
for the boiler plate being written there. But I have to decide when I'm there.

# Day 28 (2024-10-29)

I read chapter 2 and summarized the first part (up to the setup and project
initialization) both on pen and paper and later in my markdown file. I
absolutely love this (inefficient) way of working, it calms me down and gives me
deeper understanding.

# Day 27 (2024-10-28)

I started reading _Essential TypeScript 5 (3rd Edition)_. I summarized the most
important points in the introductory chapter using pen an paper, then
transferred my notes to a markdown file. This feels almost therapeutic.

# Day 26 (2024-10-27)

Against my intention from yesterday, I did not work on the exercises after
having read chapter 20. I'm simply fed up working through long given examples
and then extending them in a way that doesn't build up new knowledge. I also
read through chapter 21, but didn't even bother to follow along with the code.
_Eloquent JavaScript_ is a great book, but it's not what I need at the moment.

I finished the book by reading chapter 22 and workign through the two small
exercises. That's it for JavaScript, on towards TypeScript.

A few reflections are due after the somewhat mixed experience with _Eloquent
JavaScript_.

First, I didn't feel the urge to go deeply into it. The examples are
interesting, and Vanilla JS is something I truly like, despite the rather janky
APIs. On the other side, this learning project (JS, TS, Angular) is _pragmatic_:
I want to understand the skills necessary for doing more frontend work. So
Vanilla JS and especially DOM manipulations or "native" Node.js servers are
clearly not the priority. TypeScript is what I really need to understand. So I
hope to muster the necessary motivation for the next book.

Second, I'm pretty annoyed by the overall state of programming at the moment.
Rust is a great language, but the need to go into async programming makes
everything more complicated. I still don't like this concurrency model, but
prefer working with "green threads" as in Go or Erlang/Elixir. Unfortunately, Go
is verbose and relies on `nil`. Elixir lacks the type system I so much started
to like of Rust. There's no silver bullet. Learning yet another programming
language isn't the solution either. (OK, maybe Haskell.)

My current haunch is to devote Q1 2025 to Elixir, Ecto, and Phoenix, together
with an SQL refresher, and maybe getting deeper into PostgreSQL, which is an
absolute solid technology.

I'd also like TypeScript in a slower way. Since I won't be able to work through
the entire Angular book this year (it's far too big), I'd rather go deep with
TypeScript. Here's my plan:

- I'll be using two bookmarks: One for reading while highlighting sections, the
  other lagging behind, until I summarized the read/highlighted part.
- Then I'll summarize the highlights on paper to make sure that my notes are a)
  minimalistic rather than bloated, and b) concise rather than comprehensive.
- I only go to the computer when I have written notes. I try the concepts out,
  make some examples, and create a digital personal documentation out of it.
- I don't know yet by how much the first bookmark should lead the second one.
  Maybe I should work through entire chapters, maybe I should process a chapter
  in 2-3 parts to make sure that I'll do a complete round trip every day
  (reading/highlighting, taking notes, making examples/writing documentation). I
  tend towards the "small junks" approach, just reading a couple of pages,
  filling an A5 sheet with notes, then going to the computer. This will also
  guarantee daily commits and daily exposure to the code.

Working through the next book as I did with the last would be a waste of time.
Let's go deep and slow instead of broad and fast. (The last couple of chapters
are about Angular and React, so breadth is a given anyway.)

# Day 25 (2024-10-26)

I finished working through chapter 19, but didn't bother with the exercises. The
next part on Node.js looks more interesting, and there I'll do the exercises.

# Day 24 (2024-10-25)

I continued working through chapter 19.

# Day 23 (2024-10-24)

I started working through chapter 19, in which a pixel art editor is
implemented.

# Day 22 (2024-10-23)

I finished reading chapter 18 and integrated local storage to my repetition
counter application. I worked through the first exercise, but skipped the rest.
(I don't want to know how to evaluate user input as JavaScript code, and I
already implemented Conway's Game of Life multiple times.)

This leaves me with four chapters and eight days left, which should be doable.

# Day 21 (2024-10-22)

I finished the repetition calculator I started yesterday.

# Day 20 (2024-10-21)

I started working through chapter 18. As an own example, I started rewriting my
Rust `warmup` program as a form.

# Day 19 (2024-10-20)

I worked through the first half of chapter 17, which is about Canvas.

In the evening, I read the rest of the chapter and made some examples. Instead
of doing the exercises, I displayed the Doom Guy as sprites.

# Day 18 (2024-10-19)

I worked through the rest of chapter 16, but I didn't do the exercises, because
they don't align to what I'm trying to achieve right now. I'd like to move
through the book quickly and then learn TypeScript thoroughly.

# Day 17 (2024-10-18)

I figured out the issue from yesterday; I misread a sequence of instructions to
belong to an `if`-statement, when in fact it was only a single instruction
to be executed conditionally. (The author probably had to omit the curly braces
in order to save space on the page to prevent an ugly page break.)

I continued with the implementation of the game.

# Day 16 (2024-10-17)

I continued working through chapter 16. Unfortunately, the game isn't rendered
as intended, so I need to debug the code.

# Day 15 (2024-10-16)

I started working through chapter 16, in which a small platform game is
implemented.

# Day 14 (2024-10-15)

I read chapter 15 and worked through exercise 1 in the morning. I did the other
two exercises in the evening.

# Day 13 (2024-10-14)

I read through the very short chapter 13, which showed how to load ES modules.
However, it doesn't work using the `file://` protocol, so I need to find a very
small web server for testing.

I found darkhttpd, which does _exactly_ what I need.

I started reading chapter 14 on the train and worked through the first exercise
while waiting in the hospital. I finished the exercises on my way back.

It's October 14th, and I have finished 14 chapters out of 22. If I continue like
this, I'll be able to get started with TypeScript earlier.

# Day 12 (2024-10-13)

I finished working through chapter 12, but I skipped the exercises. I'm
interested in revisiting JavaScript, not in building programming languages.

Chapter 13 will be about the browser, which is closer to my personal goal.

# Day 11 (2024-10-12)

I half-heartedly worked through the last exercise of chapter 11, which is about
implementing `Promise.all`. I also started working through chapter 12.

# Day 10 (2024-10-11)

I finished reading chapter 11, which unfortunately uses fictional examples that
cannot be run as they are. The exercises are based on those examples, which
rather annoys me.

# Day 9 (2024-10-10)

I continued working through chapter 11. I learned about `async`/`await` and how
those keywords relate to promises, and about generators.

# Day 8 (2024-10-09)

I continued working through chapter 11 and now better understand the handling of
`Promise`.

# Day 7 (2024-10-08)

I started reading chapter 11 on asynchronous programming.

# Day 6 (2024-10-07)

I worked through chapter 10 about modules, which was rather thin. Doing some
small examples was enough, and I didn't bother working through the exercises,
which don't go beyond my own examples, or are about CommonJS, which I'll ignore.

# Day 5 (2024-10-06)

I worked through chapter 8 about errors and exception handling in the morning,
which only had two rather easy exercises.

I also worked through chapter 9 on regex during the day, which had some rather
challenging exercises.

I went rather quickly through the first 9 chapters. For October, I planned to do
two chapters in three days. Now I rather did three chapters in two days. But now
begins the part I missed out on so far: modules and async programming. It's time
to slow down and work carefully through those.

# Day 4 (2024-10-05)

I worked through chapter 6 about object-oriented programming. I learned a couple
of new features, such as private fields, static methods, and how to implement
iterators. The exercises are well-suited to the chapter.

In the evening, I worked through chapter 7. However, I didn't to do exercise 2
properly. (I remember that this chapter made me abandon the last edition of this
book roughly five years ago. So I'd rather continue without doing everything
perfectly.)

# Day 3 (2024-10-04)

I worked through chapter 5 about higher-order functions, which wasn't too
difficult, and neither were the exercises.

# Day 2 (2024-10-03)

I worked through chapter 4, which had quite some challenging exercises.

# Day 1 (2024-10-02)

I worked through chapter 3 of _Eloquent JavaScript_ and documented how to use
Deno as a REPL with a file to be evaluated first (e.g. containing function
definitions to be called inside the REPL).

I started reading chapter 4 in the evening on the train.

# Day 0 (2024-10-01)

It's October: the last quarter of the year, which I'd like to devote to web
frontend programming—at least for roughly one hour every morning.

I worked through chapter 2, which had some easy exercises to do.

By accident, I figured out that Deno has a `fmt` command, which seems to do the
same as `prettier`. Typing `deno fmt` and `prettier -w` is roughly the same, but
I'll stick to the former when I work with Deno, and use the latter in any other
environment.

# Day -1 (2024-09-30)

I read through chapter 1, which didn't have any exercises. The operator `??` was
new to me, and I wrote its semantics down in comparison to the `||` operator.

I also decided to use `prettier` as a formatter. By default, it uses double
quotes for strings, trailing commas, and a indentation with two space
characters. (I'd prefer four, but I'll stick to the standard settings
nonetheless.)

# Day -2 (2024-09-29)

I wanted to start the _Daily Frontend Grind_ in October; but here I am. I
finished my effort to learn Rust after 190 days today, in order to spend the
next three months with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular. Since it's not
October yet, I call this day "-2". But I'd like to get started anyway.

I just read the introduction of _Eloquent JavaScript_ (4th Edition). I'd like to
use Deno for the examples, except for those targeting the browser and Node.js.
Since Deno supports TypeScript out of the box, I'll also use it for _Essential
TypeScript_ (5th Edition).
