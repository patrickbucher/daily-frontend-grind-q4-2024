# Day 85 (2024-12-25)

This is it, I just threw the book away in the middle of chatper 14. Spending
time with this book absolutely annoys me. In fact, I no longer want to program,
especially not in TypeScript or JavaScript. This just sucked the life out of me.
Now I absolutely have to do anything else before I can start programming again
in a week.

This is it.

# Day 84 (2024-12-24)

I started working through the chapter on decorators. The feature looks quite
useful.

# Day 83 (2024-12-23)

I summarized the rest of chapter 13, but didn't bother too long with conditional
types. TypeScript is supposed to add clarity to the code, so it's enough for me
to know that the feature exists, but I probably won't use them for the sake of
clarity. On to chapter 14: 33 pages in eight days, i.e. a bit more than four
pages a day; feasible.

# Day 82 (2024-12-22)

I summarized section 13.4 about index types, which seem to be quite useful when
used in the context of generics. 52 pages to do in 9 days, i.e. roughly six
pages per day. I have to speed up a bit. Maybe I can work on type mappings later
today, but first I'd like to do the other stuff on my daily TODO list.

Later on, I also summarized section 13.5. This leaves me with 45 pages in 9
days, i.e. 5 pages per day.

# Day 81 (2024-12-21)

I continued summarizing chapter 13 with some examples on iterators. Figuring out
own examples is actually fun. However, this needs some trial and error, which is
better done at the computer then using pen & paper. This is _thinkering_, not
thinking. But now that I'm aware of this, I don't try to ascribe too much into
the whole exercise, so let's just thinker with the language until the end of the
year for 30-45 minutes a day.

# Day 80 (2024-12-20)

I started summarizing chapter 13 with a small example of generic collections.

# Day 79 (2024-12-19)

I'm quickly reading through chapter 13 to get an idea what "advanced generics"
is all about, and I have absolutely no clue what purpose most of the techniques
described serve. This book is absolutely frustrating. I could just have read the
official TypeScript documentation, which at least is concise.

I'm going to cut this short: chapter 15 is out. I'll be working the book through
to and including chapter 14, i.e. up to page 378. 66 pages in 13 days, i.e. a
bit more than five pages per day until the end of the year. This is enough.

# Day 78 (2024-12-18)

I finally managed to summarize chapter 12. A lot of its verbiage could be
summarized to: _this also applies to feature X_. Why demonstrating generics for
interfaces, when they behave exactly the same as for superclasses? The
machenisms are all the same. This could really have been a 200 page book.

Hopefully, chapter 13 will bring some further insight. 90 pages and 13 days
left: i.e. 7 pages per day. Let's get it done.

# Day 77 (2024-12-17)

Chapter 12 annoys me with all those cliched object-oriented examples. OOP sucks
the life out of programming and programmers. I just want to run away from it.
Maybe my sudden tiredness when facing some programming tasks is related to the
OOP allergy I developed during the last couple of years.

I have still 102 pages left in the book, but zero motivation to work through the
~8 pages per day for the rest of December. There are two things in programming
that I should totally avoid in the future: OOP and web frameworks.

# Day 76 (2024-12-16)

Very little time this morning; I a generics example involving inheritance.

# Day 75 (2024-12-15)

I continued summarizing chapter 12. I have a hard time coming up with good
examples, and my progress is really slowing down, as my motivation fades due to
a lack of practical and useful applications.

# Day 74 (2024-12-14)

After a late start today, I came up with a simpler first generic example. I'd
like to finish chapter 12 this weekend, even though I have a lot of other things
to do.

I wrote a better introductory example during the day and another example using
type shapes in the evening. Unfortunately, I'm way behind in what I achieved
compared to what I wanted to do. I had to catch up on sleep today, so tomorrow
will be a better day, hopefully.

# Day 73 (2024-12-13)

I continued with the generics example. I seriously don't see the purpose of it,
because using an interface instead of a generic parameter would work just fine
in all those examples I can think of at the moment. And the same holds true for
the author's examples.

# Day 72 (2024-12-12)

I started reading chapter 12 on generics. The first example is not convincing at
all, because a common interface would have resolved the issue in a very elegant
way. However, I only expect to learn the syntax from this book, not how those
concepts are applied in practice.

All of a sudden, an extreme tiredness overcame me. This constant learning
without the intention of applying the knowledge to some practica problem is
exhausting. And the book doesn't motivate me to use TypeScript in practice at
all.

I figured out a geometry example, in which shapes are extended to bodies by
providing an additional height. However, I don't know yet how I'll demonstrate
_all_ the techniques shown in this chapter. I'm actually doing the author's
work: finding useful examples.

# Day 71 (2024-12-11)

Yesterday, I was struggling with the _index signature_ feature, which tries to
re-introduce to TypeScript what it took away from JavaScript: dynamic
properties. I figured the issue out today. That finishes chapter 11.

There are now two chapters on generics, one chapter on decorators, and one
chapter about working with JavaScript. If I have time during the holiday break,
I'll probably dip into chapters 16 and 17 about stand-alone web applications.

With 119 pages (up to and including chapter 15) and 20 days left in December, I
need to work through six pages a day. Sounds possible.

# Day 70 (2024-12-10)

I summarized the part about interfaces and found a rather ugly solution for
yesterday's problem. I like the approach of creating one big example that
demonstrates all the concepts, especially when it comes to using known concepts
that are simply adopted to TypeScript.

# Day 69 (2024-12-09)

I read the section in chapter 11 about interfaces. My new approach is to list
all the features that have been introduced, create one large example covering
those (or most of those) features, and then summarize the introduced features
using that example. This not only makes for a shorter summary, but also for more
realistic examples.

# Day 68 (2024-12-08)

I pragmatically summarized what I read about classes yesterday. The rest of the
chapter is about interfaces, i.e. a very useful topic and one of the reasons I'm
bothering with TypeScript.

# Day 67 (2024-12-07)

I read the first half of chapter 11, which is about classes. As usual for this
topic, most code examples are just boiler plate, with the usual clichee examples
("an employee extends the person class"). The world is hierarchical, but not so
much in terms of onthological hierarchies, but containment hierarchies: it's not
important that a certain thing is a special case for some other thing, it's more
important that actual things order themselves into a hierarchy. But for the sake
of demonstrating the TypeScript featuers, I'll stick to the clichee examples.

I started summarizing the first part of the chapter.

# Day 66 (2024-12-06)

I summarized the rest of chapter 10. The subject was _type intersections_, of
which I only summarized the most obvious use cases, and only mentioned the
possible issues arising from it. Type intersections are propably a feature that
is not used too often, I guess.

I have chapters 11 to 15 left, i.e. 158 pages. December has 25 days left, which
leaves me at 6.32 pages to be summarized per day. This sounds feasible.

# Day 65 (2024-12-05)

I summarized the first part of chapter 10. The whole part could have been
summarized by a single proper code example with some explanations. I really need
to read the whole chapter again before starting summarizing it. This book is
totally bloated.

# Day 64 (2024-12-04)

I started reading chapter 10 on objects. Every chapter starts with the same
repetitive block of a preview and the instructions on how to run the example
code. The first part serves as a table of contents for the chapter and could be
useful for reference. However, the second part of that introduction is just a
copy-paste block that bloats the book up. The entire book feels bloated.

The author would like to explain a number of concepts (e.g. type annotations,
type unions, some specific compiler flags) and their applications to different
features of the JavaScript language (e.g. primitive types, functions, objects).
With the concepts on one and the area of applications on the other axis, this
creates a table of orthogonal concept-area combinations the author is working
through.

Unfortunately, he uses the areas of the JavaScript language as the main
organization principle and goes through all of the TypeScript features for a
particular area. Since all relevant JavaScript features already have been worked
through in two preceding chapters, the other approach would be much more useful,
e.g. a chapter on type unions, applying them to primitives, functions, objects
etc. This could have been a great book of 200 pages, but now we have a formulaic
and repetitive 500+ page monster.

# Day 63 (2024-12-03)

I finished reading chapter 9. It is absolutely devoid of any useful examples.
Why should I use a feature like a type literal, if the author, who is supposed
to be the expert on the subject, cannot give me a proper use case? I'd like to
know how such a feature is used in practice, not how its usage can be
demonstrated by a totally contrived example.

I only finished summarizing the chapter after my lunch break. Onto the chapter
about objects.

# Day 62 (2024-12-02)

I read the part about enums in chapter 9 and summarized it on paper, but didn't
find time to process it on the computer until after the two morning lessons.

# Day 61 (2024-12-01)

I started reading chapter 9 on arrays, tuples, enums, and the like. I summarized
the parts about arrays and tuples. The book is rather verbose; I managed to
summarize the first 12 pages to one hand-written page; examples included.

# Day 60 (2024-11-30)

Today's a lazy day, and I didn't start with my daily frontend grind before noon.
However, I managed to finish summarizing chapter 8.

# Day 59 (2024-11-29)

I continued summarizing chapter 8, for which I switched back to paper again.
Even though this seems to be a bit too much ceremony for this rather shallow
topic, this way of workig calms me down and reduces the screen time in the early
morning.

# Day 58 (2024-11-28)

I read the rest of chapter 8 and decided to rework the first part, which I
summarized yesterday. I added some examples.

It's more important to go well than to go fast. I won't tackle Angular this
year, so spendig another month with the TypeScript book is fine. I reached page
180, and I'd like to work through chapter 15, i.e. page 402. Those are 223
pages, or roughly 7-8 pages a day to be summarized. This is a realistic pace.

# Day 57 (2024-11-27)

I re-organized the TypeScript documentation. Instead of having a single file
called `notes.md`, I now have a file per chapter. This makes editing easier,
especially adding new parts. Jumping to an absolute line is a lot faster when
you have 300 instead of 3000 lines in a markdown file.

I started reading chapter 8 and summarized the section about non-matching number
of function arguments/parameters.

# Day 56 (2024-11-26)

I finished summarizing chapter 7. The last sections were about the _non_null_
and the _definitive assignment assertion_

# Day 55 (2024-11-25)

I only summarized the tiny section about the `unknown` type. I really need to
get more work done on a daily basis. Not because of the current _Daily Frontend
Grind_, but because I'd like to get more serious again next year with _Conrete
Mathematics_ and the Elixir/Phoenix stack. Rowing, math, Elixir—how can I make
room for all three on a daily basis?

# Day 54 (2024-11-24)

I summarized the rest of the part I read yesterday, but I haven't read any
further in the chapter so far.

# Day 53 (2024-11-23)

I read most of chapter 7 and summarized the first part of it. I finally learned
something new, e.g. about the `declaration` compiler option, that reveals the
types the compiler has inferred.

# Day 52 (2024-11-22)

I finished summarizing chapter 6 with the rather useful part on Unit Tests. I
now doubt that TypeScript is the right tool for teaching in the next term,
because of subtleties as importing code using a `.js` extension in production
code, and without any extension in test code (because Jest uses `CommonJS`
modules instead of `ECMAScript` modules). This just bogs everything down. Maybe
a different test framework using `ECMAScript` modules would simplify things.
Let's see…

Now I can move to part 2 of the book (finally!), which is roughly 250 pages
long.

I should write a standalone project setup tutorial with the most recent versions
of the tools, too. For ESlint, the configuration works differently now than with
the versions used in the book. This ecosystem is just way too volatile for my
taste.

I probably should use Go as a teaching language.

# Day 51 (2024-11-21)

Chapter 6 is yet another chapter on tooling, so it doesn't require careful
summarization using pen and paper, but merely documenting the most important
steps.

# Day 50 (2024-11-20)

I didn't bother too long with the rest of chapter 5, which is mostly about
compiler options. My goal is to learn the language TypeScript, which will only
be systematically introduced in chapter 7, starting at page 148.

The next chapter is on testing and debugging. This will be a useful chapter,
because I'd like to use TypeScript in school. I'll teach testing, and most
students can't work without a debugger.

I think the use of debuggers hints to problems in the development process. Once
you no longer understand the code, you resort to "operational reasoning" by
watching the code being executed. I absolute hate programming, nay: _coding_, in
this way.

# Day 49 (2024-11-19)

I summarized the next part of chapter 5, which is about various compiler
settings and automatic compilation/execution.

# Day 48 (2024-11-18)

I started working through chapter 5, which repeats some basics about setting up
TypeScript projects from chapter 2.

# Day 47 (2024-11-17)

I summarized the part about modules and thereby finished summarizing chapter 4.
It's the middle of November, and only now I actually start with working on
TypeScript.

# Day 46 (2024-11-16)

I summarized the part about collections, i.e. objects, maps, and sets.:x

# Day 45 (2024-11-15)

I summarized the rest about the section about iterators and generators.

# Day 44 (2024-11-14)

I summarized the part about generators, for which I rewrote the number sequence
iterator from yesterday.

# Day 43 (2024-11-13)

Only little time for TypeScript today: I read the section about iterators and
generators, but only summarized the first part on iterators.

I worked a bit with the [PDFKit](https://pdfkit.org/) library for a
side-project. The API is relatively straightforward, but the behaviour of the
layout engine seems erratic to me.

# Day 42 (2024-11-12)

I summarized the part about classes, for which I re-implemented the prototype
chaining examples with recent JavaScript features.

# Day 41 (2024-11-11)

I continued working through chapter 4, for which I have summarized the part on
prototype chaining, which is rather weird and uncomfortable to use. Now I really
understand why JavaScript included classes and especially the `super` keyword,
which is far more flexible than accessing the prototype's implementation
explicitly using its constructor function name and its `call` method.

# Day 40 (2024-11-10)

I started reading chapter 4. I read the entire section about prototypes and
classes. I only summarized the first half of it. (I'd rather go slow now.)

# Day 39 (2024-11-09)

I finished chapter 3 with the section about the `this` keyword, which was quite
illuminating. I also added sub-headings to the chapter, which was really
necessary considering its length!

# Day 38 (2024-11-08)

I only summarized a small section on getters and setters, and I did _not_ do so
on paper. I think the depth of my approach surpasses the depth of the material
by far. But I'd like to continue with my approach for the time being.

# Day 37 (2024-11-07)

I read and summarized the section about JavaScript objects.

Later, I realized that I'd rather spend the entire December with TypeScript
than rushing through this book like through the last one, but drop Angular for
the moment. TypeScript is a solid foundation for leearning Angular later on.
And maybe I'll use it during the next term for the programming examples, which
will allow me to keep the knowledge warm.

The entire effort was a bit too rushed: First, I went through _Eloquent
JavaScript_ way too fast, and now I'm stuck with two "JavaScript Primer"
chapters in the next book. I should have planned this differently, i.e.
skipping _Eloeuqent JavaScript_ in the first place. Anyway, November/December
will be reserved for the second book, and if I have time left in late December,
I can still do the two Angular chapters in it.

# Day 36 (2024-11-06)

I extended yesterday's list of array methods with some examples. I also
summarized the rest about arrays, now on towards objects.

# Day 35 (2024-11-05)

I continued with chapter 3, but still have a long way to go.

# Day 34 (2024-11-04)

I read roughly half of chapter 3, but only managed to summarize 6 pages instead
of the 13-14 pages required to work through the entire book in November.

# Day 33 (2024-11-03)

I finished summarizing chapter 2. For the next two chapters, which are about
JavaScript, I shall follow a more pragmatic approach to summarizing it.

I decided to focus on the first two parts of the book, omitting part 3 about
standalone, Angular, and React applications. This leaves me with 13 chapters or
361 pages. There are 27 days left in November, so I need to work through and
summarize 13-14 pages every single day. I doubt that this is feasible with only
one hour per day. But I rather go deep than fast, so stretching TypeScript into
December might be the better option, but leaves me less time with Angular.

So for the next couple of days, I'll try to work through 13-14 pages every
single day. If I can't do this in my assigned morning hour, I need to change my
plans. Let's see.

# Day 32 (2024-11-02)

I continued with chapter 2 and integrated Inquirer.js into the example. The rest
of the chapter is about persistence, which I'd like to work through tomorrow.
Next up are two chapters on JavaScript, which I'd like to summarize very
concisely.

# Day 31 (2024-11-01)

I summarized the part of chapter 2 about adding an external dependency with
additional type hints. Next up is the actual usage of the external package
Inquirer.js.

# Day 30 (2024-10-31)

I continued summarizing chapter 2 and caught up with my green bookmark, which
indicates the progress of _summarizing_ the book, with the yellow bookmark,
which indicates the progress of _reading_ the book. Tomorrow, I'll start by
reading further ahead. There's still a lot to be done in this chapter; so I'll
probably will need more time to work through the entire book, even if I don't do
the third part, or only if I do so partially. (I'm thinking about doing the
standalone web application part, skipping the React and Angular part, but work
through the Angular book afterwards, instead.)

# Day 29 (2024-10-30)

I continued processing what I've read yesterday in chapter 2. Progress is slow,
but working this way has a calming effect on me. I process the information
deeper, which is a good start into the day. I'd like to continue in this way,
even if it will take me more time to get through the book.

However, I have to think about part 3 of the book, which is about applications
in vanilla DOM, Angular, and React. Maybe pen and paper are not a good choice
for the boiler plate being written there. But I have to decide when I'm there.

# Day 28 (2024-10-29)

I read chapter 2 and summarized the first part (up to the setup and project
initialization) both on pen and paper and later in my markdown file. I
absolutely love this (inefficient) way of working, it calms me down and gives me
deeper understanding.

# Day 27 (2024-10-28)

I started reading _Essential TypeScript 5 (3rd Edition)_. I summarized the most
important points in the introductory chapter using pen an paper, then
transferred my notes to a markdown file. This feels almost therapeutic.

# Day 26 (2024-10-27)

Against my intention from yesterday, I did not work on the exercises after
having read chapter 20. I'm simply fed up working through long given examples
and then extending them in a way that doesn't build up new knowledge. I also
read through chapter 21, but didn't even bother to follow along with the code.
_Eloquent JavaScript_ is a great book, but it's not what I need at the moment.

I finished the book by reading chapter 22 and workign through the two small
exercises. That's it for JavaScript, on towards TypeScript.

A few reflections are due after the somewhat mixed experience with _Eloquent
JavaScript_.

First, I didn't feel the urge to go deeply into it. The examples are
interesting, and Vanilla JS is something I truly like, despite the rather janky
APIs. On the other side, this learning project (JS, TS, Angular) is _pragmatic_:
I want to understand the skills necessary for doing more frontend work. So
Vanilla JS and especially DOM manipulations or "native" Node.js servers are
clearly not the priority. TypeScript is what I really need to understand. So I
hope to muster the necessary motivation for the next book.

Second, I'm pretty annoyed by the overall state of programming at the moment.
Rust is a great language, but the need to go into async programming makes
everything more complicated. I still don't like this concurrency model, but
prefer working with "green threads" as in Go or Erlang/Elixir. Unfortunately, Go
is verbose and relies on `nil`. Elixir lacks the type system I so much started
to like of Rust. There's no silver bullet. Learning yet another programming
language isn't the solution either. (OK, maybe Haskell.)

My current haunch is to devote Q1 2025 to Elixir, Ecto, and Phoenix, together
with an SQL refresher, and maybe getting deeper into PostgreSQL, which is an
absolute solid technology.

I'd also like TypeScript in a slower way. Since I won't be able to work through
the entire Angular book this year (it's far too big), I'd rather go deep with
TypeScript. Here's my plan:

- I'll be using two bookmarks: One for reading while highlighting sections, the
  other lagging behind, until I summarized the read/highlighted part.
- Then I'll summarize the highlights on paper to make sure that my notes are a)
  minimalistic rather than bloated, and b) concise rather than comprehensive.
- I only go to the computer when I have written notes. I try the concepts out,
  make some examples, and create a digital personal documentation out of it.
- I don't know yet by how much the first bookmark should lead the second one.
  Maybe I should work through entire chapters, maybe I should process a chapter
  in 2-3 parts to make sure that I'll do a complete round trip every day
  (reading/highlighting, taking notes, making examples/writing documentation). I
  tend towards the "small junks" approach, just reading a couple of pages,
  filling an A5 sheet with notes, then going to the computer. This will also
  guarantee daily commits and daily exposure to the code.

Working through the next book as I did with the last would be a waste of time.
Let's go deep and slow instead of broad and fast. (The last couple of chapters
are about Angular and React, so breadth is a given anyway.)

# Day 25 (2024-10-26)

I finished working through chapter 19, but didn't bother with the exercises. The
next part on Node.js looks more interesting, and there I'll do the exercises.

# Day 24 (2024-10-25)

I continued working through chapter 19.

# Day 23 (2024-10-24)

I started working through chapter 19, in which a pixel art editor is
implemented.

# Day 22 (2024-10-23)

I finished reading chapter 18 and integrated local storage to my repetition
counter application. I worked through the first exercise, but skipped the rest.
(I don't want to know how to evaluate user input as JavaScript code, and I
already implemented Conway's Game of Life multiple times.)

This leaves me with four chapters and eight days left, which should be doable.

# Day 21 (2024-10-22)

I finished the repetition calculator I started yesterday.

# Day 20 (2024-10-21)

I started working through chapter 18. As an own example, I started rewriting my
Rust `warmup` program as a form.

# Day 19 (2024-10-20)

I worked through the first half of chapter 17, which is about Canvas.

In the evening, I read the rest of the chapter and made some examples. Instead
of doing the exercises, I displayed the Doom Guy as sprites.

# Day 18 (2024-10-19)

I worked through the rest of chapter 16, but I didn't do the exercises, because
they don't align to what I'm trying to achieve right now. I'd like to move
through the book quickly and then learn TypeScript thoroughly.

# Day 17 (2024-10-18)

I figured out the issue from yesterday; I misread a sequence of instructions to
belong to an `if`-statement, when in fact it was only a single instruction
to be executed conditionally. (The author probably had to omit the curly braces
in order to save space on the page to prevent an ugly page break.)

I continued with the implementation of the game.

# Day 16 (2024-10-17)

I continued working through chapter 16. Unfortunately, the game isn't rendered
as intended, so I need to debug the code.

# Day 15 (2024-10-16)

I started working through chapter 16, in which a small platform game is
implemented.

# Day 14 (2024-10-15)

I read chapter 15 and worked through exercise 1 in the morning. I did the other
two exercises in the evening.

# Day 13 (2024-10-14)

I read through the very short chapter 13, which showed how to load ES modules.
However, it doesn't work using the `file://` protocol, so I need to find a very
small web server for testing.

I found darkhttpd, which does _exactly_ what I need.

I started reading chapter 14 on the train and worked through the first exercise
while waiting in the hospital. I finished the exercises on my way back.

It's October 14th, and I have finished 14 chapters out of 22. If I continue like
this, I'll be able to get started with TypeScript earlier.

# Day 12 (2024-10-13)

I finished working through chapter 12, but I skipped the exercises. I'm
interested in revisiting JavaScript, not in building programming languages.

Chapter 13 will be about the browser, which is closer to my personal goal.

# Day 11 (2024-10-12)

I half-heartedly worked through the last exercise of chapter 11, which is about
implementing `Promise.all`. I also started working through chapter 12.

# Day 10 (2024-10-11)

I finished reading chapter 11, which unfortunately uses fictional examples that
cannot be run as they are. The exercises are based on those examples, which
rather annoys me.

# Day 9 (2024-10-10)

I continued working through chapter 11. I learned about `async`/`await` and how
those keywords relate to promises, and about generators.

# Day 8 (2024-10-09)

I continued working through chapter 11 and now better understand the handling of
`Promise`.

# Day 7 (2024-10-08)

I started reading chapter 11 on asynchronous programming.

# Day 6 (2024-10-07)

I worked through chapter 10 about modules, which was rather thin. Doing some
small examples was enough, and I didn't bother working through the exercises,
which don't go beyond my own examples, or are about CommonJS, which I'll ignore.

# Day 5 (2024-10-06)

I worked through chapter 8 about errors and exception handling in the morning,
which only had two rather easy exercises.

I also worked through chapter 9 on regex during the day, which had some rather
challenging exercises.

I went rather quickly through the first 9 chapters. For October, I planned to do
two chapters in three days. Now I rather did three chapters in two days. But now
begins the part I missed out on so far: modules and async programming. It's time
to slow down and work carefully through those.

# Day 4 (2024-10-05)

I worked through chapter 6 about object-oriented programming. I learned a couple
of new features, such as private fields, static methods, and how to implement
iterators. The exercises are well-suited to the chapter.

In the evening, I worked through chapter 7. However, I didn't to do exercise 2
properly. (I remember that this chapter made me abandon the last edition of this
book roughly five years ago. So I'd rather continue without doing everything
perfectly.)

# Day 3 (2024-10-04)

I worked through chapter 5 about higher-order functions, which wasn't too
difficult, and neither were the exercises.

# Day 2 (2024-10-03)

I worked through chapter 4, which had quite some challenging exercises.

# Day 1 (2024-10-02)

I worked through chapter 3 of _Eloquent JavaScript_ and documented how to use
Deno as a REPL with a file to be evaluated first (e.g. containing function
definitions to be called inside the REPL).

I started reading chapter 4 in the evening on the train.

# Day 0 (2024-10-01)

It's October: the last quarter of the year, which I'd like to devote to web
frontend programming—at least for roughly one hour every morning.

I worked through chapter 2, which had some easy exercises to do.

By accident, I figured out that Deno has a `fmt` command, which seems to do the
same as `prettier`. Typing `deno fmt` and `prettier -w` is roughly the same, but
I'll stick to the former when I work with Deno, and use the latter in any other
environment.

# Day -1 (2024-09-30)

I read through chapter 1, which didn't have any exercises. The operator `??` was
new to me, and I wrote its semantics down in comparison to the `||` operator.

I also decided to use `prettier` as a formatter. By default, it uses double
quotes for strings, trailing commas, and a indentation with two space
characters. (I'd prefer four, but I'll stick to the standard settings
nonetheless.)

# Day -2 (2024-09-29)

I wanted to start the _Daily Frontend Grind_ in October; but here I am. I
finished my effort to learn Rust after 190 days today, in order to spend the
next three months with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular. Since it's not
October yet, I call this day "-2". But I'd like to get started anyway.

I just read the introduction of _Eloquent JavaScript_ (4th Edition). I'd like to
use Deno for the examples, except for those targeting the browser and Node.js.
Since Deno supports TypeScript out of the box, I'll also use it for _Essential
TypeScript_ (5th Edition).
