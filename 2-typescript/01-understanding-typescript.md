## Understanding TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It adds static typing to produce safe
and predictable code. It also provides convenience features such as a concise
class constructor syntax, and access control keywords. Some TypeScript features
are implemented entirely by the compiler,leaving no trace of TypeScript in the
resulting JavaScript code.

Working effectively with TypeScript requires understanding JavaScript and its
type system. TypeScript allows using modern language features in code that is
transformed for execution in older JavaScript runtimes, although not every new
feature can be translated to older runtimes.
