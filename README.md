# Daily Frontend Grind Q4 2024

> A poor craftsman blames his tools.

Having spent the last six months [productively with
Rust](https://github.com/patrickbucher/learning-rust) but the last couple of
workdays rather unproductively with Angular, I have decided to change my
priorities _in anger_.

I'd like to finish working through [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and
Algorithms](https://pragprog.com/titles/jwdsal2/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-second-edition/)
by implementing the exercises and examples in Rust in September, then I'll let
Rust rest for the rest of the year. Instead, I'll be working on web frontend
technologies.

My daily grind shall look as follows: After getting up at 5 o'clock, rowing for 10 kilometers, and taking a shower, I'd like to spend the time between 6:30 and 7:30 A.M. with a book on web frontend technologies. Here's my choice:

- October: JavaScript with [Eloquent JavaScript, 4th Edition](https://nostarch.com/eloquent-javascript-4th-edition)
    - 22 chapters, 456 pages
    - I have to work through roughly 2 chapters every 3 days.
- November: TypeScript with [Essential TypeScript 5, 3rd
  Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/essential-typescript-5-third-edition)
    - 21 chapters, 568 pages
    - Again: roughly 2 chapters ever 3 days.
- December: Angular with [Angular. Das gro√üe Praxisbuch, 4
  Ausgabe](https://angular-buch.com/)
    - 42 chapters, 930 pages
    - Which is probably way too much for December, but the first 25 chapters
      look essential.
    - Yes, it's a German book. At least they don't try to be funny all the time.

This will be a lot of work in an already busy fourth quarter of the year, but
let's give web frontend programming a chance once again.

I'll keep a [diary](diary.md) as usual and hope to not miss a single day.

Maybe I'm back to Rust again in January, maybe I'd like to look into Haskell
once more, or maybe I'll do something else then. But at least I'll be a bit more
productive when doing frontend work.
